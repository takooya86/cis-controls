# CIS Controls and Their Complement to NIST Publications

## Introduction
The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls are a set of best practices designed to secure IT systems and data. These controls complement various NIST publications, including the NIST SP 800-53 (Security and Privacy Controls) and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). This README outlines how the CIS Controls align with and support the implementation of NIST guidelines.

### 1. CIS Controls Overview
The CIS Controls consist of 18 critical security measures designed to mitigate the most common cyber threats. These controls are divided into three implementation groups (IG1, IG2, IG3) based on organizational size and maturity.

Key areas covered by CIS Controls include:
- Asset Inventory
- Vulnerability Management
- Access Control
- Incident Response
- Data Protection

*Key takeaway*: CIS Controls provide actionable, prioritized security practices that can enhance an organizationâ€™s security posture and support compliance with NIST guidelines.

### 2. Complementing NIST SP 800-53

NIST SP 800-53 provides a comprehensive catalog of security and privacy controls that organizations can implement. Many of the **CIS Controls** map directly to specific control families in NIST SP 800-53.

- **CIS Control 1: Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets**  
  Complements **NIST SP 800-53, CM-8 (Configuration Management: Information System Component Inventory)** by ensuring proper tracking of all devices and systems.

- **CIS Control 4: Secure Configuration for Hardware and Software on Mobile Devices, Laptops, Workstations, and Servers**  
  Complements **NIST SP 800-53, CM-6 (Configuration Management: Configuration Settings)** by ensuring that configurations across devices are secure and standardized.

- **CIS Control 7: Continuous Vulnerability Management**  
  Aligns with **NIST SP 800-53, RA-5 (Risk Assessment: Vulnerability Scanning)** by supporting vulnerability assessment practices and tools for ongoing system scans.

- **CIS Control 17: Incident Response Management**  
  Complements **NIST SP 800-53, IR (Incident Response Control Family)** by providing procedures for detecting and responding to security incidents.

### 3. Complementing NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

The **NIST CSF** is a voluntary framework that provides organizations with a way to improve their cybersecurity posture through a continuous, risk-based approach. Many of the **CIS Controls** map directly to the CSF's five functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

- **CIS Control 1 (Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets)** supports the **Identify** function of the NIST CSF by helping organizations track and manage hardware and software.
  
- **CIS Control 4 (Secure Configuration)** supports the **Protect** function by ensuring secure configuration of systems to reduce vulnerabilities.

- **CIS Control 7 (Continuous Vulnerability Management)** supports the **Detect** function by enabling regular scanning for vulnerabilities.

- **CIS Control 17 (Incident Response Management)** supports the **Respond** function by providing procedures for responding to security incidents.
